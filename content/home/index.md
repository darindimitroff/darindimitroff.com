# Hey, I'm Darin
### Digital product designer who codes

I'm a digital product designer living in Sofia. Currently I work at [The Crazy Ones](http://thecrazyones.agency), a product design shop I co-founded with my partner [Kalina](http://kalinaivanova.com). Through the years I've done work for early stage startups as well as major corporations. Before I switched to product, I used to work in advertising. I try to spend more time away from technology and digital distractions. Read more about me [here](/about.html) or check out my [list of cool shit](/cool-stuff.html).
